# Leaf-Me-Spaceapp-Challenge-2015
Leaf image recognition app

Take a picture, then calculate and display percent results. Advanced options would add display of surface ozone data for that location for the last five days. If possible, you can add or display a satellite image for that area to provide context
(i.e., Landsat Leaf Area Index or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).
The app could:
guide a user through a protocol for taking a single leaf image;
acquire a picture of a leaf through a smartphone camera;
use the colors in the photo to calculate the area of the leaf and
determine the fraction of the leaf that has been injured by ozone.
Present the results of the analysis using the classification described on page 69 of the Ozone-Induced Foliar Injury Guide (link below) and present the last 5 days of surface ozone for the userâ€™s location.
